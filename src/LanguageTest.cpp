/*
 *  LanguageTest.cpp
 *
 *  Language quiz program.
 *        Takes in a two-column file, stores it, and then quizzes and then quizzes
 *         the user on the translations.
 *
 *
 *  Created by AÃ±dy Eschbacher on 4/29/11.
 *
 *
 *  Create an alternate mode called 'direct feedback' where the user
 *  instantly learns her/his wrong answer -- or even slighly delayed -- kind of
 *  learning-machine like, and not being in the dark and moving onto another
 *  word instead, which could lead to some mental muddiness and focus on
 *  trouble words.
 *
 *  Contained lessons/quizzes.  Lessons that have a clear ending point so
 *  the student will feel a sense of satisfaction on completing a unit.
 *  They can be performance-related, time-related, number-of-items-related,
 *  or more...
