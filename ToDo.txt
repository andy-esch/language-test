Official To Do List

* Add Unicode support! so é, ñ, etc. are supported -- Andy, Sept. 18
	Using http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/unicode.html as a source

* Modify input to look for synonyms that are comma seperated (Support both languages)
* Sort test results by failure/success, or let user define how they want it to be sorted, such as 
alphabetically, by number correct, etc.
* Add another hint option (-e or -u ?) which shows an example or usage in a sentence
* Add another hint option (-s) which gives a synonym (not a very high penalization value -- 
weight = 0.05?)
* Restructure the data that contains words?  Or is it sufficient?  
* Make a commandline option for choosing which language to be quizzed over
* Add more modules to the program such as conjugating verbs, an antonym quiz (given bien, answer 
either malo or bad), idiom quiz, ...
* Have an option for combining multiple vocab lists
* Add an option for increasing the number of words as the user approaches a certain level of 
mastery within the current session
* Parallelize some of it using OpenMP to speed up the updateScore() function?
* Create accounts so you can continue from past progress
	-- First we need a standard output file and an input/output function that knows how to read and write from/to it
* Have an option for being quizzed randomly between languages: such as: bien, avocado, fish, 
el tenedor, whale, la mesa, etc.
